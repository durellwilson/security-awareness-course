# Understanding Deepfakes

## What Are Deepfakes?

Deepfakes are **synthetic media** created using AI to manipulate or generate visual and audio content with high realism.

## Types of Deepfakes

### 1. Face Swaps
Replace one person's face with another in videos or images.

**Risk**: Identity theft, fraud, defamation

### 2. Voice Cloning
Replicate someone's voice to generate fake audio.

**Risk**: Phone scams, authorization bypass

### 3. Lip Sync Manipulation
Change what someone appears to say while maintaining facial features.

**Risk**: Misinformation, political manipulation

### 4. Full Body Synthesis
Create entirely fake people with realistic movements.

**Risk**: Fake identities, catfishing

## How They're Created

### Technology Stack
1. **GANs** (Generative Adversarial Networks)
2. **Autoencoders** - Face mapping and reconstruction
3. **Voice Synthesis** - Text-to-speech AI models
4. **Motion Capture** - Body movement replication

### Common Tools
- DeepFaceLab
- FaceSwap
- Wav2Lip
- First Order Motion Model

## Real-World Impact

### Financial Fraud
> **Case Study**: In 2019, criminals used AI voice technology to impersonate a CEO, stealing **$243,000** from a UK energy company.

### Political Manipulation
- Fake politician statements
- Election interference attempts
- Public opinion manipulation

### Personal Harm
- Non-consensual intimate imagery (**96%** of deepfakes)
- Reputation damage
- Harassment campaigns

## Warning Signs

### Visual Indicators
- ❌ Unnatural blinking patterns
- ❌ Inconsistent lighting/shadows
- ❌ Blurry face boundaries
- ❌ Mismatched skin tones
- ❌ Odd facial movements
- ❌ Artifacts around hairline

### Audio Indicators
- ❌ Robotic speech patterns
- ❌ Inconsistent background noise
- ❌ Unnatural breathing
- ❌ Pitch inconsistencies
- ❌ Lack of emotional variation

## Statistics
